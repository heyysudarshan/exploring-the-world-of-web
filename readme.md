### Trying JavaScript

JavaScript is the language of the web. While I enjoy Kotlin more, there are things only JavaScript can do. The web
development ecosystem is built around it, so I decided to give it a try: especially since I build my internal
documentation sites and all websites using `React.js` and `Next.js`. This module covers the essential JavaScript
features you need to get started or refresh your knowledge. You can always refer to any JavaScript documentation site to
dive deeper.

1. Write a simple `Hello World` program.
2. Add single-line and multi-line comments.
3. Create a mutable variable using the `let` keyword.
4. Create an immutable variable using the `const` keyword.
5. Explore the different data types available in JavaScript.

### Thank you ðŸ™Œ

I'm glad you took the time to check out this repository. I know how challenging it can be to learn a new language or
switch from another one-especially when you already have a solid language by your side. I picked up JavaScript just to
get the front-end work done for web development, but I hope you'll go beyond that. All the best, and welcome to the
world of JavaScript. Thank you so much for exploring this repository!
